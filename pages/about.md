This website exists to catalogue the collected writings and images of American Oneironautics. AO was founded at some point in the 2010s. It will dissolve in 2332 CE, exactly two hundred years after the catastrophic events of April 13th, 2032. However, since time doesn&#39;t really mean anything, you shouldn&#39;t take these dates too seriously. What matters is that AO, at some point, existed. If you&#39;re reading this before 2332 and after the 2010s, then it currently exists. If you&#39;re reading this before the 2010s, it doesn&#39;t exist yet, but will. And if you&#39;re reading this after 2332, it doesn&#39;t exist, and also we are sincerely sorry for all the trouble we past-people have caused you. Not sorry enough to stop, but sorry enough to feel a little bad about it.

To contact American Oneironautics, write to: americanoneironautics@gmail.com

or put your letter in an envelope, write &quot;SEND TO AO&quot; really big on the envelope in crayon, stick it in your mailbox (with a stamp) and hope the mail people are bros.

You can also send us a fax, but we&#39;re not going to get it, since we don&#39;t have a fax machine.
